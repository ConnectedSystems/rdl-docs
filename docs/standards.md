# Standards

list of existing data exchange formats, taxonomies and other relevant/related standards, with:

 - a link to more information
 - a brief note about their purpose or value in the domain
 - how they relate to the RDL model and the library

This would be a useful reference for anyone looking to improve exchange of risk data, or understand how the RDL data model aligns with other standards.
Intention isn't to have an exhaustive list, just reference the most important standards that are used in the data model and implementations.
