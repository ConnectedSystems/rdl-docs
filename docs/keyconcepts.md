## What is risk data

The foundation of Disaster Risk Management is understanding and measuring the hazard phenomena, the people and asset exposed to these hazards and their vulnerability. The quantification of risks allows governments, communities, and individuals to take informed decisions to anticipate the potential impacts of hazards.
A disaster risk assessment provides a foundation for long-term engagement and investment focused on reducing existing risk and avoiding the creation of new risk. Appropriate communication of robust risk information at the right time can raise awareness and trigger action to reduce risk.

## Risk Terminology

<ul><li class="lis"><b>Hazard:</b> A process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.  Hazards may be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects. Each hazard is characterized by its location, intensity or magnitude, frequency and probability. An hazardous event is the manifestation of a hazard in a particular place during a particular period of time.
<br>
Hazards can have natural or anthropogenic origin. Natural hazards are associated with natural processes and phenomena (geological, geophysical and hydrometeorological).<br>
<ul><li class="lic"><b><i>Geological or geophysical hazards</b></i> originate from internal earth processes. Examples are earthquakes, volcanic activity and emissions, and related geophysical processes such as mass movements, landslides, rockslides, surface collapses and debris or mud flows. Hydrometeorological factors are important contributors to some of these processes.
<li class="lic"><b><i>Hydrometeorological hazards</b></i> are of atmospheric, hydrological or oceanographic origin. Examples are tropical cyclones (also known as typhoons and hurricanes); floods, including flash floods; drought; heatwaves and cold spells; and coastal storm surges. Hydrometeorological conditions may also be a factor in other hazards.
<li class="lic"><b><i>Biological hazards</b></i> are originated or conveyed by biological vectors, including pathogenic microorganisms, toxins and bioactive substances. Examples are bacteria, viruses or parasites, as well as venomous wildlife and insects, poisonous plants and mosquitoes carrying disease-causing agents.</ul>
Multi-hazard means (1) the selection of multiple major hazards that the country faces, and (2) the specific contexts where hazardous events may occur simultaneously, cascadingly or cumulatively over time, and taking into account the potential interrelated effects.
<br><br>
<li class="lis"><b>Exposure:</b> The situation of people, infrastructure, housing, production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas. Measures of exposure can include the number of people or types of assets in an area. These can be combined with the specific vulnerability and capacity of the exposed elements to any particular hazard to estimate the quantitative risks associated with that hazard in the area of interest.
<br><br>
<li class="lis"><b>Vulnerability:</b> The conditions determined by physical, social, economic and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets or systems to the impacts of hazards. The inverse of vulnerability is defined coping capacity, which is the combination of all the strengths, attributes and resources available within an organization, community or society to manage and reduce disaster risks and strengthen resilience.
<br><br>
<li class="lis"><b>Disaster Risk:</b> The potential loss of life, injury, or destroyed or damaged assets which could occur to a system, society or a community in a specific period of time, determined probabilistically as a function of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity.<br>
Disaster risk comprises different types of potential impacts and losses (direct and indirect, tangible and intangible) which are sometimes difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, with knowledge of the prevailing hazards, the patterns of population and socio-economic development and their tendency to suffer impacts, disaster risks can be assessed and mapped, at least in broad terms.
