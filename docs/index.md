# Risk Data Library Standard

The Risk Data Library standard (RDL) is an open data standard making it easier to create, share, find and use disaster and climate risk data. It provides a common and simple language to describe the different data used in conducting a disaster risk assessment: **hazard**, **exposure**, **vulnerability**, and **risk** (loss or impact) data. 

The RDL aims to improve the availability and quality of disaster and climate risk data globally. It is intended to be used by a broad range of stakeholders including development and humanitarian organizations, research and academia, as well as (re)insurance companies.

The RDL has been developped to better support governments and their population in managing disaster risk and adapting to climate change. It is a collaborative project managed by the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)](https://www.gfdrr.org/) of the World Bank Group.
