# Introduction

The Risk Data Library (RDL) standard provides a data model for the four components of risk data: **hazard**, **exposure**, **vulnerability** and **modelled impact and losses**.
The standard defines a consistent framework for describing these data types, with risk-specific metadata.

The RDL standard makes datasets significantly easier to identify, understand and integrate into other applications, as they are formatted with a common structure and metadata tailored to the requirements of risk modelling.

The RDL standard is expected to benefit disaster risk analysts, Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) practitioners and academic researchers applying risk analytics in the in the development, reinsurance and humanitarian sectors.
